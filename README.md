- The main page opens at the root path (`/contacts`).
- A sample XML file named `contacts.xml` is provided in the root directory for testing the import functionality.
- The project uses SQLite as the database.
- CRUD operations are implemented using the Repository pattern for better code organization and maintainability.
- The frontend UI is designed using Bootstrap, and data listing is handled using the DataTables package for enhanced table features.
